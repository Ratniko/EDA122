\section{Conclusions}
\label{S6}
From the evaluation performed in this laboratory assignment it has become clear that the architecture of choice have large impact on the reliability of a brake-by-wire system.  In the results presented in \secref{S4} it can easily be seen that one of the candidate architectures comes out on top of the other, namely the centralized one. 

A manufacturer of a brake-by-wire system would by using the centralized architecture have the choice to either deliver a product with longer life-time, or being able to lower the design constraints for failure rate during development, compared to a distributed design. Another advantage would be that, if the design constraint for reliability is high, using the centralized architecture would make it easier to meet the design constraints.

As mentioned in \secref{S5}, the assumptions made will not hold in a real system. But, as the goal was to compare the two architectures, and the assumptions for both are the same, the results can still be used. This also applies for the evaluation period, which is under four years, and that not a complete system have been modeled.
