The choice of implementing either of the two designs is influenced by more factors than the results of a reliability evaluation as conducted in this laboratory assignment. Other properties that is of value is for example cost, maintainability, and modifiability. The cost is of coarse of major concern and the maintenance can be a significant part of the life-time cost. It is hard for us to guess about any cost differences, as the two systems utilize the same amount of hardware. One point in favor for the centralized architecture is that it is probably easier to physically replace a computer module in the CU than in a WU. If the software is updated with more complex routines, the CMs which derives the brake commands must maybe be upgraded. In the centralized design three CMs need to be replaced, compared to eight in the distributed design. However, the CMs replaced in the centralized design has higher processing capabilities but are, as mentioned, probably easier to replace, the lesser time it takes to replace the three MCs versus the eight makes it probably more cost effective to use the centralized design.
